# raspModules
This repository contains main files related to the Docker containerized Flask modules for the car's decision-making, perception, and prediction.
This is part of a PhD project.
The code runs under Raspberry Pi 3 Model B edge nodes with Quad Core CPUs running at 1.2 GHz and 1 GB RAM, along with the SUNFOUNDER Raspberry Pi Smart Car Kit. Both use the Debian Buster OS and have the ARM32V7 architetcure.
The Raspberry Pis communicate through Wifi and through a netwrok made by Docker Compose.
Some of the code uses the ball_track sunfounder code (https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-v/en/latest/ball_tracker.html).
